# GiphyAPI-HW

Giphy API app that generates 10 gifs when the button is clicked and can add new buttons to search. This one is based on sitcoms, but technically you can search anything.

I used Bootstrap for some of the design/layout, and I wanted the ratings to look like the MPAA ratings font from movie trailers, which is why they look like that. 

As far as I can tell, everything functions properly and how I intended it to function.
